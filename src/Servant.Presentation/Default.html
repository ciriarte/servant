                <h3 style="text-align: center;">What is Servant for IIS?</h3>
                <p>Servant is a piece of software that transforms your regular Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager to a modern, fast and web-based website management tool.</p>
                <p>It's designed to fit your daily routines, optimized to track down your worst problems and created to stop you from wasting time on administration.</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">Web interface</h3>
                <p>Servant is accessed as any other website. You just enter your credentials from a web browser and you instantly got access to every setting on your IIS.</p>
                <p>The web interface is the core of Servant. There isn't any application or server console - everything happens over HTTPS. You'll never need to connect to your server or install
                    some software to manage your server. You just enter the URL of your Servant-enabled server, even from your smartphone.</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">Simplified tasks</h3>
                <p>Getting all the settings right can be hard. Especially when you have to find just the right one between hundreds of unneccessary options. With Servant everything is simplified
                    and automated as much as absolutely possible.</p>
